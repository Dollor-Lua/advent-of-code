# Advent of Code

These are all of the files I used to complete Advent of Code, currently only containing 2023 (although I did do 2022). When I get around to it, I will complete the previous years of Advent of Code.

To respect this repository, please do not steal my answers, instead you may use them to learn from (or translate into other languages, but make sure you understand what these scripts do). The core.h file in source/ along with the tools folder are free of use, just make sure you credit me (and the person who made the MD5 script) in your projects. Note the documentation for the core.h script is INCOMPLETE and needs to be REWRITTEN.

Want to test any of these files or don't understand how I obtain the input? The test.bat and test.sh files allow for easy testing. Simply run `test [filename]`, ex `test 2023/day1p1` to test source/2023/day1p1.cpp (or on unix systems `$ ./test.sh 2023/day1p1`). Note that you place your input in a file named `input.txt`, as per Advent of Code copyright I cannot sync my input.txt file to github, although to add one place it in the same folder as this readme.
