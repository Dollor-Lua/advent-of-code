## Notice

Advent of Code this year has become very... well, theres no good way to put this. It's not really fun anymore. I might stop doing days alltogether, or I may only do them every once and a while. I don't want to say Eric Wastl didn't work hard to create this, but the days are starting to seem very repetitive, with everything being some form of grid. Day 16 was the last day I could really take the gruesome task of finishing these challenges, with day 15 being sweet relief, with hopes of that continuing. I love the difficulty, but reusing the same concept for the 10th time with some slight changes to rework the order isn't fun. I will eventually get around to finishing all of the days, but now isn't the time. Challenges are meant to be fun, not to be a chore, and thats what this year's advent of code feels like to me. Maybe I'll host my own challenge event to really put to the test how hard these challenges are to make, if you look forward to that, join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/r4BfjWRWsj), or simply if you're looking forwards to future updates on this repo.

Note: I want to say this especially shows with my day 16 part 2, where the script took 4 minutes and still gave me a correct answer. The script isn't written efficiently, but its also no task a computer should really be handling. It's illogical grid manipulation that even with experiences in game development, I have never found a purpose for what was needed.

# Advent of Code

These are all of the files I used to complete Advent of Code, currently only containing 2023 (although I did do 2022). When I get around to it, I will complete the previous years of Advent of Code.

To respect this repository, please do not steal my answers, instead you may use them to learn from (or translate into other languages, but make sure you understand what these scripts do). The core.h file in source/ along with the tools folder are free of use, just make sure you credit me (and the person who made the MD5 script) in your projects. The documentation for the core.h file will be rewritten after I complete AoC 2023.

Want to test any of these files or don't understand how I obtain the input? The test.bat and test.sh files allow for easy testing.
First setup the directory by navigating to the setup folder and then running whichever script for your operating system, then navigate back to the top level directory and simply run:

```batch
test 2023/day1p1
```

For unix systems, run:

```bash
$ ./test.sh 2023/day1p1
```

replace the 2023/day1p1 with whichever file you want (without the .cpp extension).
Note that you place your input in a file named `input.txt`, as per Advent of Code copyright I cannot sync my input.txt file to github, although to add one place it in the same folder as this readme.
