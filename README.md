# Advent of Code

These are all of the files I used to complete Advent of Code, currently only containing 2023 (although I did do 2022). When I get around to it, I will complete the previous years of Advent of Code.

Sorry for 2023 day 4 being missing, it's on my laptop

Will get around to splitting the days into multiple scripts some other time, along with converting old scripts to use the new utility library I wrote (core.h), which you may freely use in your own projects. Some scripts may not work as the project structure has changed over time.
