# List of all missing files

All files listed here need to be found or recreated.

NOTE: These files are most likely going to be remade from scratch.
What is defined as missing is if I completed the file and got an answer but do not have the file anymore.
Ex: I have 6 stars from AOC2022, but none of the first 3 days as a file (lost when I built my new computer)
